**[Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/#)** is a Python library and open-source project that introduces a data structure with named dimensions, coordinates and attributes that wrap NumPy-like arrays. This allows the co-location of raw data and metadata for complex, n-dimensional datasets in ways that streamline scientific analysis, enabling more consise, readable and intuitive workflows.

**[Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#)** is a Python library for reading and writing data stored as Zarr groups and arrays. Zarr is built for array-like data and has flexible storage backends making it suitable data stored in local file systems as well as cloud object storage.

**[Pangeo](https://www.pangeo.io/)** is a community scientists, developers, and practitioners dedicated to promoting open, reproducible, and scalable science. Members of the Pangeo community develop and contribute to open-source software libraries within the geosciences and across scientific domains, including Xarray, Dask, Zarr, and Jupyter.

In addition to these software libraries, the Pangeo community emphasizes the development of educational resources (see [Project Pythia](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html)), regular community [meetings](https://www.pangeo.io/meetings) and [showcase talks](https://www.pangeo.io/showcase), and working groups on specialized topics.
