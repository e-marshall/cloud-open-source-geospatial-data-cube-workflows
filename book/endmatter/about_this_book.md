# About this book

These tutorials were initially developed while Emma Marshall interned with the Summer Internships in Parallel Computational Sciences ([SIParCS](https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/outreach/internships)) program at the National Center for Atmospheric Research ([NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/)). Jessica Scheick, Scott Henderson, and Deepak Cherian were internship supervisors for this project. The internship was also supported by a NASA Open Source Tools, Frameworks, and Libraries program (Award  80NSSC22K0345), with a specific focus on developing educational resources for working with cloud-hosted data using Xarray. Tutorial development continued after the conclusion of the SIParCS internship when Emma Marshall returned to the University of Utah as a Ph.D. student, where she was supported by a (insert finesst grant no ? ).
