# Metadata naming conventions
(maybe include in relevant concepts?)
- Metadata naming
    - metadata naming conventions reduce duplicated effort by setting consistent expectations for how different types of information will be stored and identified. 
    - They also create a common starting place from which tools can develop, which can dramatically transform user experiences. 
Examples of metadata naming conventions are:
- CF Metadata conventions
- STAC
Examples of tools borne out of these conventions are:
- CF_Xarray (which makes big parts of Xvec possible)
- PySTAC
- stackstac
