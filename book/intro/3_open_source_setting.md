# 1.3 Open source setting
## *Xarray, Zarr, and the Pangeo software stack*


**[Pangeo](https://www.pangeo.io/)** is a community scientists, developers, and practitioners dedicated to promoting open, reproducible, and scalable science. Members of the Pangeo community develop and contribute to open-source software libraries within the geosciences and across scientific domains, including Xarray, Dask, Zarr, and Jupyter.

In addition to these software libraries, the Pangeo community emphasizes the development of educational resources (see [Project Pythia](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html)), regular community [meetings](https://www.pangeo.io/meetings) and [showcase talks](https://www.pangeo.io/showcase), and working groups on specialized topics.

## Why open-source?

This book intentionally focuses on publicly available data and open-source software tooling. As discussed in the next [chapter](../background/1_context_motivation.md), this book was developed in the context of the proliferation of publicly-available earth observation datasets. It was also written amidst the increasingly urgent crisis of anthropogenic climate change and the consequent need for data-driven adaptation, mitigation, and management strategies that are rooted in robust and comprehensive understandings of Earth's climate and biophysical systems. 

Research that follows principles of open, reproducible science is necessary in order to produce rigorous and robust scientific knowledge that can be applied to address the myriad challenges facing society in the 21st century. In data-intensive, computational scientific fields, open-source software and accessible data are essential elements of open scientific workflows {cite}`gilGeosciencePaperFuture2016,wilkinsonFAIRGuidingPrinciples2016`.
